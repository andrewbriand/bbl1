1. Answers to questions for initial and final runs

a. Initial

i. Test corpus:

Our results for the test corpus using the lab 2 grammar are the same as at the end of lab 2, namely: 

	1. How many items parsed? 151 out of 999
        2. Average parses per item? 25.43
        3. Parses for the most ambiguous item? 496
        4. We continue to see ambiguity due to coordination being allowed between practically any two constituents without clitics or conjunctions, and having multiple lexical rules with the same function and morphological form that are applied to a single word to produce multiple trees.

ii. Lab 3 test suite:

Using our extended lab 3 test suite, our lab 2 grammar produced the following results:

	1. How many items parsed? 19 out of 60 (39 of which are positive examples)
	2. Average parses per item? 6.47
        3. Parses for the most ambiguous item? 20
        4. We see ambiguity due to asyndetic coordination being allowed between constituents as due to the misinterpretation of first person pronouns as verbs. We also still see ambiguity due to multiple lexical rules having the same effect.

For question 5, we analyzed the semantics of 10 sentences from our lab 3 testsuite, since our test corpus and grammar were the same as in lab 2:

1. 
as y-erst'-n-as
1sg.erg cm(f)-gain.weight-aor-1sg.erg
'I (F) put on weight [on purpose].'

The semantics for the only tree produced by this sentence seem reasonable. The arg1 of _gain_weight_v_rel is the _pron_n_rel corresponding to "as" ('I'). 

2.
ebi t'ot'-i d-a
these.ones hand;paw;branch-PL cmdjsg-be.IMPV
'These are hands'

Here the v_rel is called '_be (present)_v_rel' which should probably be changed to simply '_be_v_rel'. In all 10 trees "ebi" is interpreted as a determiner whereas it should be a demonstrative pronoun. Accordingly, none of the semantic analyses have a _pron_n_rel. Some of the analyses identify _hand;paw;branch_n_rel with ARG1 of '_be (present)_v_rel' while others identify it with ARG2.

3.
so y-arst'-e-sʷ
1sg.abs cm(f)-gain.weight-prs-1sg.abs
'I (F) am putting on weight [unintentionally].'

10 of the parses for this sentence interpret 'so' as a verb, giving a semantic representation where a member of the non-focus feature structure is both the an argument of a '_toward speaker_v_rel' and the '_gain_weight_v_rel'. These analyses additionally have an 'and_coord_rel' as the grammar interprets this sentence as having asyndetic coordination between the two "verbs." In the other two parses, "so" is correctly interpreted as a first person pronoun, giving a semantic representation in which the ARG0 of '1sg_n_rel' is identified with the ARG1 of '_gain_weight_v_rel.'

4. 
equi-n y-abc' i
this.one.dat cm-know that.one.abs
'this one knows that one'

The semantic representations for both trees produced by this sentence seem reasonable identifying ARG1 of '_know_v_rel' with ARG0 of 'this_one_n_rel' and ARG2 with ARG0 of 'that_one_n_rel.'

5. 
oqus tet'-o xen
yon.one cut(present)-present tree
(S)he cuts the tree / (S)he is cutting the tree

For the only parse produced for this sentence, the verb arguments seem reasonable, ARG2 of 'cut (impf)_v_rel' being identified with ARG0 of _tree_n_rel and ARG1 being identified with ARG0 of 'yon_one_n_rel.' However, 'cut (impf)_v_rel' should be simply 'cut_v_rel' and there appears to be no tense information inthe semantics despite the verb marking for present tense.

6. 
oqus tit'-o xen
yon.one cut(future)-future tree
(S)he will cut the tree 

Both parses for this sentence had reasonable argument semantics with ARG1 of 'cut (pfv)_v_rel' identified with ARG0 of 'yon_one_n_rel' and ARG2 identified with ARG0 of '_tree_n_rel'. However 'cut (pfv)_v_rel' should be simply 'cut_v_rel' and there is no information about tense despite the verb being marked for future tense.

7.
oqus dol tepx-ʷ
yon.one.erg drum(j/j).abs play-prs
'They (sg) play the drum.'

In 3 of the 4 parses for this sentence, 'they' and 'drum' are interpreted as being asyndetically coordinated, leading to unreasonable semantic representations. The semantic representation for the fourth parse looks reasonable, except that '_play (impf)_v_rel' should simply be '_play_v_rel'. ARG1 of 'play (impf)_v_rel' is correctly identified with ARG0 of '_yon_one_n_rel' and ARG2 is correctly identified with '_drum_n_rel'

8.
o dol tepx-ʷ
yon.one.abs drum(j/j).abs play-prs
'They (sg) play the drum.'

This sentence is actually ungrammatical, but produces 3 parses in which 'they' and 'drum' are asyndetically coordinated, leading to unreasonable semantic representations.

9.
ebi bader-i d-a
these.ones child-PL cmdd-be.IMPV
'These are children'

Here the v_rel is called '_be (present)_v_rel' which should probably be changed to simply '_be_v_rel'. In both trees "ebi" is interpreted as a determiner whereas it should be a demonstrative pronoun. Accordingly, none of the semantic analyses have a _pron_n_rel. One of the analyses has a '_be (present)_v_rel' in which ARG2 is identified with '_child_n_rel' where as the other simply has a '_child_n_rel' and no reference to verbs.

10. 
oqus tet'-in xen
yon.one cut(aorist imperfective)-aorist tree
(S)he did cut (multiple times) the tree

The semantics for the only parse here look reasonable in that ARG0 _tree_n_rel is identified with ARG2 of '_cut (impf)_v_rel' and ARG0 of '_yon_one_n_rel' is identified with ARG1 of '_cut (impf)_v_rel'. However '_cut (impf)_v_rel' should simply be '_cut_v_rel' and there is no mention of the aorist despite the verb being marked for it.

b. Final

i. Test Corpus

	1. How many items parsed? 145 out of 999
        2. Average parses per item? 20.18
        3. Parses for the most ambiguous item? 242
        4. We still see ambiguity due to coordination being allowed between practically any two constituents asyndetically, and having multiple lexical rules with the same function applied to a single word to produce multiple trees. This second source of ambiguity was reduced by the changes we made detailed in part 3 of the writeup, however.

ii. Lab 3 test suite

	1. How many items parsed? 19 out of 60 (39 of which are positive examples)
	2. Average parses per item? 5.21
        3. Parses for the most ambiguous item? 17
        4. We still see ambiguity due to asyndetic coordination being allowed between constituents as due to the misinterpretation of first person pronouns as verbs. We also still see ambiguity due to multiple lexical rules having the same effect, though this was reduced through our morphotactic changes from the initial test run.

We analyzed the semantics of 10 sentences from our test corpus with the new lab 3 grammar:

1.
k'ač'aro dapxol meq'-o .
wool:ERG warmth stay present formant (+impf) .
Wool holds warmth.

None of the semantics here look reasonable, as 'wool' and 'warmth' are initerpreted as being coordinaed asyndetically in all 3 parses.

2.
bʕerc'-a-ɣ v-erc'-in st'ak' .
wolf SG thematic ending? ADV CM (M.sg) turn into (+preradical CM) aorist formant man, person, human .
The man became a wolf.

The semantics for this sentence are reasonable in that one parse has the ARG1 of '_turn into (+preradical cm)_v_rel' identified with the ARG0 of '_wolf_n_rel' and the ARG2 with '_man, person, human_n_rel'. The other parse has the arguments swapped, which is acceptable since case cannot distinguish them in this case. '_turn into (+preradical cm)_v_rel' should simply be '_turn_into_v_rel' as "(+preradical cm)" is morphological information about the verb contained in the original gloss.

3.
kortʷ-e-ɣ b-erc'-in qer .
head SG thematic vowel between stem and case ending ADV CM (B/d) turn into (+preradical CM) aorist formant stone .
A stone became the head.

Again, '_turn into (+preradical cm)_v_rel' should simply be '_turn_into_v_rel' as "(+preradical cm)" is morphological information about the verb contained in the original gloss. Again, two interpretations are proposed with the arguments of this v_rel swapped, as case cannot distinguish them, so the semantics appear reasonable.

4.
k'uit'i d-a .
cat CM (d/d) be (present) .
It's a cat.

The semantics seem reasonable here, with one of the arguments of '_be (present)_v_rel' identified with RARG of a non-focus structure and the other identified with the ARG0 of 'cat_n_rel'. '_be (present)_v_rel' should again be simplt '_be_v_rel'

5.
k'uit'i d-a-nuic .
cat CM (d/d) be (present) evidential? indeed? .
It is indeed a cat.

This grammar gives the same semantics to this sentence as the last one, which i s probably not reasonable since there is no mention of evidentiality in the semantics. The same comment applies again for '_be (present)_v_rel'.

6.
k'uit'i d-a=e .
cat CM (d/d) be (present) =and .
It's a cat.

The semantics are again the same as 4. We are not sure if this is reasonable since the linguist gives the same translation but this sentence includes a coordination clitic.

7.
band y-a .
rag, duster CM (y/y) be (present) .
It's a rag.

Again, one of the arguments of '_be (present)_v_rel' is identified with RARG of a non-focus structure and the other identified with the ARG0 of '_rag,duster_n_rel'. '_be (present)_v_rel' should again be simply '_be_v_rel'.

8.
vir d-a-ra .
donkey CM (d/d) be (present) imperfect present (after present formant) . 
There was a donkey.

This sentence has the same semantics as 7 and 4 with a '_be (present)_v_rel' taking a non-focus argument and 'donkey' in either ARG1 or ARG2. It has no mention of tense or aspect information despite the verb being marked for it.

9.
moħ d-ec'e aɬ-an ?
how CM (d/d) should, must (+CM) say, talk about (pfv; no CM) infinitive ?
How should one say it?

'_should,must (+cm)_v_rel' should simply be '_should,must_v_rel' here. The question word 'how' is interpreted as a noun and the ARG1 of 'should'. Additionally the verb 'say' here is interpreted as '_become?_v_rel', so the semantics are not very reasonable.

10.
kayrcxi d-itː-o .
clothing; the wash CM (d/d) wash (+preradical CM) present formant (+impf) .
They're washing clothes.

The semantics here seem reasonable here for one parse with clothing identified as the ARG2 of the verb '_wash (+preradical cm)_v_rel' However, the two other parses have it as the ARG1. '_wash (+preradical cm)_v_rel' should simply be '_wash_v_rel' and there is no mention of aspect in the semantics. 

2. Phenomena added to the testsuite

a. Coordination

Coordination takes three forms in Tsova-Tush. First, in asyndetic coordination, clauses are placed next to each other without a conjunction. Second, clauses can be combined through the use of the coordinating conjunction, for example "e." Third, constituents and clauses can be combined through the use of a clitic. In the following examplefrom our testsuite, "donkey" and "man" are coordinated with the use of the clitic "=e":

# 30: Coordination: Clitic
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Coordination
vir=e st'ak=e d-arst'-e
donkey=and man=and cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

Note that since "donkey" and "man" have different genders, the verb takes d/d agreement. We therefore also added a negative test case to ensure this agreement is enforced:

# 31: Coordination: Clitic, subjects of different genders trigger (d/d) agreement
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Coordination
vir=e st'ak=e j-arst'-e
donkey=and man=and cm(j/j)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

Since the first two forms of coordination, asyndeton and conjunction, can only be used with clauses and not constituents, we added the following negative examples:

# 28: Coordination: Parataxis cannot be used with constituents
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Coordination
vir st'ak d-arst'-e
donkey man cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

# 32: Coordination: Conjunction cannot be used with constituents
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Coordination
vir e st'ak d-arst'-e
donkey and man cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

Finally, we added the following two grammatical examples to demonstrate the clausal uses of these two forms of coordination:

# 29: Coordination: Parataxis
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Coordination
k'uit' d-arst'-e, st'ak v-arst'-e
cat cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs, man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
A cat is gaining weight and a man is gaining weight

# 33: Coordination: Conjunction
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Coordination
k'uit' d-arst'-e, e st'ak v-arst'-e
cat cm(d/d)-gain,weight-prs, and man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
A cat is ganing weight and a man is gaining weight

b. Demonstrative adjectives (rest of NP)

There are three demonstrative adjectives in Tsova-Tush, each of which agrees with the noun in case. The following table reproduced from our reference shows their forms:

	'this'	'that'	'yon'
ABS	e	is	o
OBL	eq	icx	oq

We used variations on the following test case to test the absolutive forms of these adjectives:

# 34: Demonstrative adjectives: absolutive
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
e st'ak v-arst'-e
this.ABS man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
This man is gaining weight

We included negative examples such as the following where the wrong case of the adjective has been used:

# 35: Demonstrative adjectives: absolutive
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
eq st'ak v-arst'-e
this.OBL man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
This man is gaining weight

To test the oblique forms of these adjectives (which are employed with nouns in all other cases), we used variations on the following example:

# 40: Demonstrative adjectives: oblique
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
eq bader-i-v ʡok'-i y-aq'-o 
this.OBL child-PL-ERG crescent.shaped.pastry-PL cm(y/y)-eat-IMPF
These children are eating pancakes

We again included negative examples where the wrong case of the adjective was used:

# 41: Demonstrative adjectives: oblique
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
e bader-i-v ʡok'-i y-aq'-o 
this.ABS child-PL-ERG crescent.shaped.pastry-PL cm(y/y)-eat-IMPF
These children are eating pancakes

Additionally, we included a negative example where the demonstrative adjective is placed after the noun it describes:

# 46: Demonstrative adjectives: Demonstrative adjective preceeds noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
bader-i-v oq ʡok'-i y-aq'-o 
child-PL-ERG yon.OBL crescent.shaped.pastry-PL cm(y/y)-eat-IMPF
Yon children are eating pancakes

c. Tense and aspect

Tense and aspect fall into three groups in Tsova-Tush: present, future, and aorist.  The present group
is based on the imperfective stem of the verb, the future group is based on the perfective stem of the verb,
and the aorist is based on both the perfective and the imperfective stems.  Our literature summarizes the tense/aspect
groups as follows:

-Present group: present, imperfect
-Future group: future, future imperfect
-Aorist group: imperfective aorist, perfective aorist, imperfective perfect, perfective perfict

Tsova-Tush has optional evidentiality markers that combine with verbs to identify information obtained through
second-hand sources.  These markers can be left unspecified.  There is one form of evidentiality that combines
with the future and present tenses, and a different form that combines with the aorist group.

Our literature provided a table with conjuguations for the various tense/aspect combinations we found
helpful in understanding the different meanings, based on the verb cut, taking a third person subject.  A
sentence with the following verb was found in our test corpus, and from that sentence and the conjugations
in the table we extrapolated examples of the different tense/aspect/evidentiality combinations.

The sentence from our corpus:
	oqus tit'-en xen
	yon.one cut(aorist perfective)-aorist tree
	(S)he did cut the tree

Paradigm of the verb "cut" from the literature:

Present group, based on the imperfect stem of the verb 'cut', tet'ar:
	Present: tet'-o (s/he) cuts, is cutting
	Imperfect: tet'-ora (s/he) used to cut
	Imperfect reported: tet'-ralʷ

Future group, based on the perfect stem of the verb 'cut', tit'ar:
	Future: tit'-o (s/he) will cut
	Imperfect: tit'-ora (s/he) will cut (multiple times)
	Imperfect reported: tit'-ralʷ (s/he) evidently will cut

Aorist imperfective group, based on the imperfect stem tet'ar:
	Aorist: tet'-in (s/he) cut, did cut (multiple times)
	Perfect: tet'-ir (s/he) had cut (multiple times)
	Aorist reported: tet'-ino (s/he) evidently cut, did cut (multiple times)
	Perfect reported: tet'-nor (s/he) evidently had cut (multiple times)

Aorist perfective group, based on the perfect stem tit'ar:
	Aorist: tit'-en (s/he) cut, did cut
	Perfect: tit'-er (s/he) had cut
	Aorist reported: tit'-eno (s/he) evidently cut, did cut
	Perfect reported: tit'-nor (s/he) evidently had cut

Test sentences have been added to our test suite representative of each tense/aspect/evidentiality combination. For example, the following were added for the present group, for present, imperfect, and imperfect reported:

# 47: Tense/aspect: Present group
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tense/aspect
oqus tet'-o xen
yon.one cut(present)-present tree
(S)he cuts the tree / (S)he is cutting the tree

# 48: Tense/aspect: Present group
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tense/aspect
oqus tet'-ora xen
yon.one cut(present)-imperfect tree
(S)he used to cut the tree 

# 49: Tense/aspect: Present group
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tense/aspect
oqus tet'-ralʷ xen
yon.one cut(present)-imperfect.reported tree
(S)he evidently used to cut the tree 

3. Documentation of morphotactic improvements

We renamed the following position classes to make them clearer:

Renamed noun-pc13 -> noun-yes-no-question-particle
Renamed noun-pc18 -> noun-and-clitic
Renamed noun-pc20 -> noun-plural-for-people
Renamed noun-pc30 -> noun-thematic-extension

We added a position class called Number to handle noun number marking. The position class has lexical rule types to add an empty suffix to a noun to make it singular (noun-pc10_lrt2) or the '-i' suffix to make a noun plural (noun-pc10_lrt1). An example of a sentence affected by this change is the following:

niq' b-a .
road CM (B/d) be (present) . 
This is a road.

Two parses in which 'niq' (road) was interpreted as being plural were eliminated by this change, bringing the count from 6 to 4.

We removed lexical rule type noun-pc21_lrt2 and noun position class noun-pc51 as they both were responsible for adding the -i suffix indicating plurality for nouns, a task now handled by the Number noun position class. We added noun25 and noun4 as inputs to Number to cover the inputs taken by noun-pc21 and noun-pc51. These changes have an effect on the following sentence:

esmaⁿ-s t'ot'-i y-il-u
Esman (female name) ERG.S for humans and nouns ending in /o/ or /u/ hand; paw; branch PL CM (F.sg) wash (+pre and postradical CM) present formant (+impf) .
Esman is washing (her) hands.

Before the change, the parse chart has 9 feature structures in the box above t'ot'-i, including one for noun-pc21_lrt2 and plural_suffix (from the Number noun position class). After this change, there are only 6, including plural_suffix but not noun-pc21_lrt2.

We removed noun-pc19_lrt2, noun-pc9_lrt2, noun-pc12_lrt3, and noun-pc35_lrt3, all of which took many different inputs and made a noun ergative without a suffix. As far as we could tell viewing the results from our test corpus and using the compare functionality in tsdb, this had no effect in our test corpus, so we don't have an IGT example for this one.

We removed noun-pc35 and noun-pc53 completely, as noun-pc35 only contained lexical rule types to 1) make nouns ergative without a suffix (noun-pc35_lrt3) or add suffixes -a and -e with no features, which are already covered by noun-pc1. The following two sentences are among those affected:

oqus b-ʕog-in koǰo gago-e-n mak
3S.ERG / that one CM (B/d) break (+preradical CM) aorist formant broom knee SG thematic vowel between stem and case ending DAT on (+DAT)
(S)he broke the broom on (his/her) knee.

The number of parses for this sentence is halved from 32 to 16, as previously 'gago-e-n' could be analyzed either through noun-pc35 or noun-pc1.

as tit'-n-as st'eplaʔo ħo-n-e-n .
1S.ERG cut (pfv) AOR 1S.ERG carrot 2S DAT SG thematic vowel between stem and case ending DAT . 
I chopped a carrot for you.

This sentence no longer parses, as ħo-n-e-n could not be analyzed. It could previously be analyzed through noun-pc35_lrt suffix 2 "-e" which accepts noun-pc9 as an input. This was the only sentence that stopped parsing after this change.

Our morphological changes brought the average analyses per sentence down from 25.43 to 20.18. Our coverage went from 15.1% to 14.5%.
