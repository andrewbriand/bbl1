1. Answers to questions for initial and final runs

a. Initial

i. Test corpus:

Our results for the test corpus using the lab 2 grammar are the same as at the end of lab 2, namely: 

ii. Lab 3 test suite:

For the new test suite including our lab 3 additions, our lab 2 grammar 

We analyzed the semantics of 10 sentences from our lab 3 testsuite, since our test corpus and grammar were the same as in lab 2:



b. Final

i. Test Corpus

ii. Lab 3 test suite

We analyzed the semantics of 10 sentences from both our test corpus and lab 3 test suite:


2. Phenomena added to the testsuite

a. Coordination

Coordination takes three forms in Tsova-Tush. First, in asyndetic coordination, clauses are placed next to each other without a conjunction. Second, clauses can be combined through the use of the coordinating conjunction, for example "e." Third, constituents and clauses can be combined through the use of a clitic. In the following examplefrom our testsuite, "donkey" and "man" are coordinated with the use of the clitic "=e":

# 30: Coordination: Clitic
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Coordination
vir=e st'ak=e d-arst'-e
donkey=and man=and cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

Note that since "donkey" and "man" have different genders, the verb takes d/d agreement. We therefore also added a negative test case to ensure this agreement is enforced:

# 31: Coordination: Clitic, subjects of different genders trigger (d/d) agreement
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Coordination
vir=e st'ak=e j-arst'-e
donkey=and man=and cm(j/j)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

Since the first two forms of coordination, asyndeton and conjunction, can only be used with clauses and not constituents, we added the following negative examples:

# 28: Coordination: Parataxis cannot be used with constituents
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Coordination
vir st'ak d-arst'-e
donkey man cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

# 32: Coordination: Conjunction cannot be used with constituents
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Coordination
vir e st'ak d-arst'-e
donkey and man cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs
A donkey and a man are gaining weight

Finally, we added the following two grammatical examples to demonstrate the clausal uses of these two forms of coordination:

# 29: Coordination: Parataxis
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Coordination
k'uit' d-arst'-e, st'ak v-arst'-e
cat cm(d/d)-gain.weight-prs, man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
A cat is gaining weight and a man is gaining weight

# 33: Coordination: Conjunction
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Coordination
k'uit' d-arst'-e, e st'ak v-arst'-e
cat cm(d/d)-gain,weight-prs, and man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
A cat is ganing weight and a man is gaining weight

b. Demonstrative adjectives (rest of NP)

There are three demonstrative adjectives in Tsova-Tush, each of which agrees with the noun in case. The following table reproduced from our reference shows their forms:

	'this'	'that'	'yon'
ABS	e	is	o
OBL	eq	icx	oq

We used variations on the following test case to test the absolutive forms of these adjectives:

# 34: Demonstrative adjectives: absolutive
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
e st'ak v-arst'-e
this.ABS man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
This man is gaining weight

We included negative examples such as the following where the wrong case of the adjective has been used:

# 35: Demonstrative adjectives: absolutive
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
eq st'ak v-arst'-e
this.OBL man cm(v/b)-gain.weight-prs
This man is gaining weight

To test the oblique forms of these adjectives (which are employed with nouns in all other cases), we used variations on the following example:

# 40: Demonstrative adjectives: oblique
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
eq bader-i-v ʡok'-i y-aq'-o 
this.OBL child-PL-ERG crescent.shaped.pastry-PL cm(y/y)-eat-IMPF
These children are eating pancakes

We again included negative examples where the wrong case of the adjective was used:

# 41: Demonstrative adjectives: oblique
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
e bader-i-v ʡok'-i y-aq'-o 
this.ABS child-PL-ERG crescent.shaped.pastry-PL cm(y/y)-eat-IMPF
These children are eating pancakes

Additionally, we included a negative example where the demonstrative adjective is placed after the noun it describes:

# 46: Demonstrative adjectives: Demonstrative adjective preceeds noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: Demonstrative adjectives
bader-i-v oq ʡok'-i y-aq'-o 
child-PL-ERG yon.OBL crescent.shaped.pastry-PL cm(y/y)-eat-IMPF
Yon children are eating pancakes

c. Tense and aspect

Tense and aspect fall into three groups in Tsova-Tush: present, future, and aorist.  The present group
is based on the imperfective stem of the verb, the future group is based on the perfective stem of the verb,
and the aorist is based on both the perfective and the imperfective stems.  Our literature summarizes the tense/aspect
groups as follows:

-Present group: present, imperfect
-Future group: future, future imperfect
-Aorist group: imperfective aorist, perfective aorist, imperfective perfect, perfective perfict

Tsova-Tush has optional evidentiality markers that combine with verbs to identify information obtained through
second-hand sources.  These markers can be left unspecified.  There is one form of evidentiality that combines
with the future and present tenses, and a different form that combines with the aorist group.

Our literature provided a table with conjuguations for the various tense/aspect combinations we found
helpful in understanding the different meanings, based on the verb cut, taking a third person subject.  A
sentence with the following verb was found in our test corpus, and from that sentence and the conjugations
in the table we extrapolated examples of the different tense/aspect/evidentiality combinations.

The sentence from our corpus:
	oqus tit'-en xen
	yon.one cut(aorist perfective)-aorist tree
	(S)he did cut the tree

Paradigm of the verb "cut" from the literature:

Present group, based on the imperfect stem of the verb 'cut', tet'ar:
	Present: tet'-o (s/he) cuts, is cutting
	Imperfect: tet'-ora (s/he) used to cut
	Imperfect reported: tet'-ralʷ

Future group, based on the perfect stem of the verb 'cut', tit'ar:
	Future: tit'-o (s/he) will cut
	Imperfect: tit'-ora (s/he) will cut (multiple times)
	Imperfect reported: tit'-ralʷ (s/he) evidently will cut

Aorist imperfective group, based on the imperfect stem tet'ar:
	Aorist: tet'-in (s/he) cut, did cut (multiple times)
	Perfect: tet'-ir (s/he) had cut (multiple times)
	Aorist reported: tet'-ino (s/he) evidently cut, did cut (multiple times)
	Perfect reported: tet'-nor (s/he) evidently had cut (multiple times)

Aorist perfective group, based on the perfect stem tit'ar:
	Aorist: tit'-en (s/he) cut, did cut
	Perfect: tit'-er (s/he) had cut
	Aorist reported: tit'-eno (s/he) evidently cut, did cut
	Perfect reported: tit'-nor (s/he) evidently had cut

Test sentences have been added to our test suite representative of each tense/aspect/evidentiality combination. For example, the following were added for the present group, for present, imperfect, and imperfect reported:

# 47: Tense/aspect: Present group
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tense/aspect
oqus tet'-o xen
yon.one cut(present)-present tree
(S)he cuts the tree / (S)he is cutting the tree

# 48: Tense/aspect: Present group
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tense/aspect
oqus tet'-ora xen
yon.one cut(present)-imperfect tree
(S)he used to cut the tree 

# 49: Tense/aspect: Present group
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tense/aspect
oqus tet'-ralʷ xen
yon.one cut(present)-imperfect.reported tree
(S)he evidently used to cut the tree 

3. Documentation of morphotactic improvements

We renamed the following position classes to make them clearer:

Renamed noun-pc13 -> noun-yes-no-question-particle
Renamed noun-pc18 -> noun-and-clitic
Renamed noun-pc20 -> noun-plural-for-people
Renamed noun-pc30 -> noun-thematic-extension

We added a position class called Number to handle noun number marking. The position class has lexical rule types to add an empty suffix to a noun to make it singular (noun-pc10_lrt2) or the '-i' suffix to make a noun plural (noun-pc10_lrt1). An example of a sentence affected by this change is the following:

niq' b-a .
road CM (B/d) be (present) . 
This is a road.

Two parses in which 'niq' (road) was interpreted as being plural were eliminated by this change, bringing the count from 6 to 4.

We removed lexical rule type noun-pc21_lrt2 and noun position class noun-pc51 as they both were responsible for adding the -i suffix indicating plurality for nouns, a task now handled by the Number noun position class. We added noun25 and noun4 as inputs to Number to cover the inputs taken by noun-pc21 and noun-pc51. These changes have an effect on the following sentence:

esmaⁿ-s t'ot'-i y-il-u
Esman (female name) ERG.S for humans and nouns ending in /o/ or /u/ hand; paw; branch PL CM (F.sg) wash (+pre and postradical CM) present formant (+impf) .
Esman is washing (her) hands.

Before the change, the parse chart has 9 feature structures in the box above t'ot'-i, including one for noun-pc21_lrt2 and plural_suffix (from the Number noun position class). After this change, there are only 6, including plural_suffix but not noun-pc21_lrt2.

We removed noun-pc19_lrt2, noun-pc9_lrt2, noun-pc12_lrt3, and noun-pc35_lrt3, all of which took many different inputs and made a noun ergative without a suffix. As far as we could tell viewing the results from our test corpus and using the compare functionality in tsdb, this had no effect in our test corpus, so we don't have an IGT example for this one.

We removed noun-pc35 and noun-pc53 completely, as noun-pc35 only contained lexical rule types to 1) make nouns ergative without a suffix (noun-pc35_lrt3) or add suffixes -a and -e with no features, which are already covered by noun-pc1. The following two sentences are among those affected:

oqus b-ʕog-in koǰo gago-e-n mak
3S.ERG / that one CM (B/d) break (+preradical CM) aorist formant broom knee SG thematic vowel between stem and case ending DAT on (+DAT)
(S)he broke the broom on (his/her) knee.

The number of parses for this sentence is halved from 32 to 16, as previously 'gago-e-n' could be analyzed either through noun-pc35 or noun-pc1.

as tit'-n-as st'eplaʔo ħo-n-e-n .
1S.ERG cut (pfv) AOR 1S.ERG carrot 2S DAT SG thematic vowel between stem and case ending DAT . 
I chopped a carrot for you.

This sentence no longer parses, as ħo-n-e-n could not be analyzed. It could previously be analyzed through noun-pc35_lrt suffix 2 "-e" which accepts noun-pc9 as an input. This was the only sentence that stopped parsing after this change.

Our morphological changes brought the average analyses per sentence down from 25.43 to 20.18 and the number of lexical analyses per word down from 1.5 to 1.35. Our coverage went from 15.1% to 14.5%.
