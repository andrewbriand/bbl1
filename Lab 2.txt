1. Yes, you may share this and future write ups with students working on AGGREGATION

2. The automatically constructed choice file customized and compiled right off the bat without any
asterisks.  There were some ? about sentential negation, but we weren't sure how to answer those,
so we just compiled the grammar as-s.

3. Answers to questions about the tsdb() runs:
Initial run
	1. How many items parsed?
	223 of 999
	2. Average parses per item?
	32.11
	3. Parses for the most ambiguous item?
	408
	4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	The sentences with ambiguity will have many trees with the
	same structure (NP--N--N--N--word) but each tree will have
	different lexical rules applied in different orders
	5. In class
Second run, after improvements

Andrew's stuff:

There are two main valencies for transitive verbs in Tsova-Tush. 
The first requires the subject of the verb to be in the ergative case and the object of the verb 
to be in the absolutive case. Here are some examples of this word order, both grammatical and ungrammatical:

 # 6: Transitive: canonical
Source: a:65
vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
oqus dol tepx-ʷ
yon.one.erg drum(j/j).abs play-prs
'They (sg) play the drum.'

# 7: Transitive: canonical, subject is ergative
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
o dol tepx-ʷ
yon.one.abs drum(j/j).abs play-prs
'They (sg) play the drum.'

# 8: transitive: canonical, object should be absolutive
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
equs y-it icxus
this.one.erg cm-wash that.one.erg
'this one washes that one'

The second requires the subject of the verb to be in the dative case and the object to be in the absolutive case:

# 9: transitive: dative subject
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
equi-n y-abc' i
this.one.dat cm-know that.one.abs
'this one knows that one'

# 10: transitive: dative subject, subject should be dative
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
equs y-abc' i
this.one.erg cm-know that.one.abs
'this one knows that one'

# 11: transitive: dative subject, object should be absolutive
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
equi-n y-abc' icxui-n
this.one.dat cm-know that.one.dat
'this one knows that one'

There are three main valencies for intransitive verbs in Tsova-Tush, those that invariably take an absolutive subject, 
those that take an ergative 1st or 2nd person subject and an absolutive 3rd person subject, 
and those that can either take either an absolutive or ergative subject in the first or second person take 
take an absolutive subject in the third person. Since 1st and 2nd person subjects require special agreement with the verb, 
I only demonstrated the first and third cases in my test suite. 
I should be able to model the second case easily as well once the agreement is more fleshed out and we can handle more examples. 
Here are the intransitive examples from the test suite:

# 1: Intransitive: invariant
Source: a:64
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
q'ar y-atx
rain(j/j).abs cm-drip
'It is raining.' (lit., 'Rain drips/falls.')

# 2: Intransitive: split S by person and volition
Source: a:64
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
so y-arst'-e-sʷ
1sg.abs cm(f)-gain.weight-prs-1sg.abs
'I (F) am putting on weight [unintentionally].'

# 3: Intransitive: split S by person and volition
Source: a:64
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
as y-erst'-n-as
1sg.erg cm(f)-gain.weight-aor-1sg.erg
'I (F) put on weight [on purpose].'

# 4: Intransitive: split S by person and volition
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
o y-arst'-e
yon.one.abs cm(f)-gain.weight-prs
'She is putting on weight'

# 5: Intransitive: split S by person and volition, 3rd person subject must be absolutive
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
oqus y-arst'-e
yon.one.erg cm(f)-gain.weight-prs
'She is putting on weight'

I handled this by defining verb types for each of the above patterns, specifying them as intransitive or transitive, 
and them specifying the appropriate case on their subjects and objects. I then added stems and predicates to the types for the verbs 
in my test suite. 

Additionally, I had to specify case for the nouns occurring in my test suite. For the ergative and absolutive forms of 
the demonstratives and pronouns, I simply made a noun type for the ergative forms and one for the absolutive forms. 
For the dative forms, I made an oblique stem noun type, and a noun position class to add the dative suffix. 
For the case person agreement on verbs with 1st and 2nd person subjects, I added temporary dummy suffixes for 
now to parse the sentences.
