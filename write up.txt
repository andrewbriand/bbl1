Write up:
1. Yes, you may share this and future write ups with students working on AGGREGATION

2. The automatically constructed choice file customized and compiled right off the bat without any
asterisks.  There were some ? about sentential negation, but we weren't sure how to answer those,
so we just compiled the grammar as-s.

3. Answers to questions about the tsdb() runs:
Initial run
	1. How many items parsed?
	223 of 999
	2. Average parses per item?
	32.11
	3. Parses for the most ambiguous item?
	408
	4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	Coordination is creating a lot of ambiguity, because our grammar allows things to coordinate without a coordination word,
	so it seems anything and everything can coordinate to make phrases.  There is also a lot of ambiguity related to different 
	lexical rules being applied in various orders, but it seems as though many of those sentences do not vary much in terms of
	the semantics. 
	5. Semantics for 10 sentences:
		1. e kotam d-a, transcribed in our corpus as "This is a chicken" (sentence 5)
		The semantics seem somewhat reasonable.  The noun kotam 'chicken' is the
		argument of the determiner-like word e, which has the 'exist' predication,
		and also the argument of the verb 'd-a', which means 'be'.  The structure of
		how they are put together is a bit strange, but the meaning seems to have come through.
		2. ħo leʔ kotam-e-ɣ y-erc'-an, in our corpus meaning "You want to become a chicken" (sentence 35)
		None of these semantics seem great (plus this is a strange sentence).  All the trees
		have coordination, and are combining things in a way I do not think is correct - for instance,
		the arguments of the coordinator are the verb "want" and the verb "become", and instead the
		verb "become" makes more sense as an argument of "want" rather than joined via coordination.
		3. sara bader-i-cin labc', "Sara is playing with the children" (sentence 77)
		The semantics seem reasonable for the sentences without coordination.  Sara and children
		are both the arguments of the verb "play". 
		4. kori-e-go laːtː-e-ra, "(S/he was standing by the window)" (sentence 82)
		The semantics seem reasonable, though it is strange to see sentences that do not have subjects after
		working with English.  Window is the argument of exist, and also the argument of stand.  There is a "non-local"
		argument for stand as well which I assume is the unstated "s/he"
		5. e sen daq'ar d-a, "This is my food" (sentence 9)
		Semantics don't seem to imply possession.  As with many other of the sentences, there are multiple exist predications.  
		One exist predication as the same ARG0 values as the first person pronoun, which seems to imply "I exist", and the
		other exist predication takes the argument of the food.  The being present verb takes as its arguments the pronoun
		and the food, but I don't see anything linking the food and the posessive pronoun together.
		6. k'oba-s qer qos-in kotam-e-n, "Kota threw a stone at a chicken" (sentence 38)
		Semantics don't really work.  There is a lot of coordination that doesn't necessarily make sense.
		Many exist predications - Kota exists, a stone exists, the act of throwing exists, and the chicken exists.  Chicken
		is an argument of throw, but stone is not an argument of throw.
		7. but: b-a, "This is the moon" (sentence 12)
		Semantics are good - moon is an argument of the exist predication and the "be" predication.
		8.  e sen mar v-a, "This is my husband" (sentence 22)
		Semantics of possession again seem like they are not working correctly - there is nothing in the semantics linking
		the "my" pronoun to husband
		9. lav d-a, "There is snow" (sentence 19)
		Semantics are good - snow is the argument of the exist predication and the "be" predication.
		10. k'eč'-e-n šindri d-a, "There are wool socks" (sentence 46)
		Semantics are not great - links wool and socks to the exist predication, but nothing that seems to 
		link the wool and socks together.  Seems more like it means "there is wool and there are socks"
		

Second run, after changes made to the choices file
	1. How many items parsed?
	151
	2. Average parses per item?
	25.43
	3. Parses for the most ambiguous item?
	496
	4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	We continue to see many of the same sources - coordination and various lexical rules.  Some of the sentences now have more
	readings, largely because of the lexical rules created to try and handle agreement (see further discussion in that section below)
	5. Semantics for 10 sentences, the same 10 chosen as before:
		1. e kotam d-a, transcribed in our corpus as "This is a chicken" (sentence 5)
		Semantics have not changed, though there are more readings this time than before.
		2. ħo leʔ kotam-e-ɣ y-erc'-an, in our corpus meaning "You want to become a chicken" (sentence 35)
		Semantics have not changed following our adjustments.
		3. sara bader-i-cin labc', "Sara is playing with the children" (sentence 77)
		This sentence is no longer parsing
		4. kori-e-go laːtː-e-ra, "(S/he was standing by the window)" (sentence 82)
		This sentence is no longer parsing
		5. e sen daq'ar d-a, "This is my food" (sentence 8)
		Semantics are unchanged and still don't seem to imply possession. 
		6. k'oba-s qer qos-in kotam-e-n, "Kota threw a stone at a chicken" (sentence 38)
		This sentence is no longer parsing
		7. but: b-a, "This is the moon" (sentence 12)
		Semantics are unchanged and still seem good
		8.  e sen mar v-a, "This is my husband" (sentence 22)
		Semantics of possession continue to be bad
		9. lav d-a, "There is snow" (sentence 19)
		Semantics are unchanged and good
		10. k'eč'-e-n šindri d-a, "There are wool socks" (sentence 46)
		Sentence is no longer parsing

		New sentences, as 4 of the original choices did not parse on the second run:
		1. dažar-e-ɣ d-erc'-a-ħe-ra e xen-bi, "O for these trees to become grass!" (sentence 112)
		Semantics seems reasonable (though there is no RELS for the exclamation O).  Grass is ARG1
		of the verb turn into, and tree is ARG2 of the verb turn into
		2. as tet'-o-as xaxʷ, "I am cutting an onion" (sentence 260)
		Semantics look good - pronoun I is the ARG1 of cut, and noun onion is ARG2.
		3. daħ tit' st'eplaʔo, "Chop the carrot" (sentence 258)
		The semantics has more information than the translation, as there is a "away from speaker" RELS that 
		takes cut and carrot as an argument.  I'm curious if that is accurate.
		4. žagno st'ol mak lepč, "The book lies on the table" (sentence 206)
		Semantics don't make much sense.  All of the trees have strange coordination, combining constituents that
		don't make sense to be combined. The RELS for up and lie are combined, but there is nothing linking the 
		table or the book to the other RELS.

Run of our test suite sentences:
	1. 14 of our sentences parsed
	2. Average parses per item is 10.93
	3. The most ambigious item received 52 parses
	4. The biggest source of ambiguity is the problem I had trying to constrain agreement.  I discuss this further below,
	but coordination and other phrase structure rules continued to make NP constiuents that did not have the gender/number
	of the daughters, so there was nothing to prevent verbal prefixes from forming ungrammatical sentences.

4-5
The topics this week we attempted were case and agreement.

For case:

There are two main valencies for transitive verbs in Tsova-Tush. 
The first requires the subject of the verb to be in the ergative case and the object of the verb 
to be in the absolutive case. Here are some examples of this word order, both grammatical and ungrammatical:

 # 6: Transitive: canonical
Source: a:65
vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
oqus dol tepx-ʷ
yon.one.erg drum(j/j).abs play-prs
'They (sg) play the drum.'

# 7: Transitive: canonical, subject is ergative
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
o dol tepx-ʷ
yon.one.abs drum(j/j).abs play-prs
'They (sg) play the drum.'

# 8: transitive: canonical, object should be absolutive
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
equs y-it icxus
this.one.erg cm-wash that.one.erg
'this one washes that one'

The second requires the subject of the verb to be in the dative case and the object to be in the absolutive case:

# 9: transitive: dative subject
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
equi-n y-abc' i
this.one.dat cm-know that.one.abs
'this one knows that one'

# 10: transitive: dative subject, subject should be dative
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
equs y-abc' i
this.one.erg cm-know that.one.abs
'this one knows that one'

# 11: transitive: dative subject, object should be absolutive
Source: author
vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
equi-n y-abc' icxui-n
this.one.dat cm-know that.one.dat
'this one knows that one'

There are three main valencies for intransitive verbs in Tsova-Tush, those that invariably take an absolutive subject, 
those that take an ergative 1st or 2nd person subject and an absolutive 3rd person subject, 
and those that can either take either an absolutive or ergative subject in the first or second person take 
take an absolutive subject in the third person. Since 1st and 2nd person subjects require special agreement with the verb, 
I only demonstrated the first and third cases in my test suite. 
I should be able to model the second case easily as well once the agreement is more fleshed out and we can handle more examples. 
Here are the intransitive examples from the test suite:

# 1: Intransitive: invariant
Source: a:64
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
q'ar y-atx
rain(j/j).abs cm-drip
'It is raining.' (lit., 'Rain drips/falls.')

# 2: Intransitive: split S by person and volition
Source: a:64
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
so y-arst'-e-sʷ
1sg.abs cm(f)-gain.weight-prs-1sg.abs
'I (F) am putting on weight [unintentionally].'

# 3: Intransitive: split S by person and volition
Source: a:64
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
as y-erst'-n-as
1sg.erg cm(f)-gain.weight-aor-1sg.erg
'I (F) put on weight [on purpose].'

# 4: Intransitive: split S by person and volition
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: case
o y-arst'-e
yon.one.abs cm(f)-gain.weight-prs
'She is putting on weight'

# 5: Intransitive: split S by person and volition, 3rd person subject must be absolutive
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: case
oqus y-arst'-e
yon.one.erg cm(f)-gain.weight-prs
'She is putting on weight'

I handled this by defining verb types for each of the above patterns, specifying them as intransitive or transitive, 
and them specifying the appropriate case on their subjects and objects. I then added stems and predicates to the types for the verbs 
in my test suite. 

Additionally, I had to specify case for the nouns occurring in my test suite. For the ergative and absolutive forms of 
the demonstratives and pronouns, I simply made a noun type for the ergative forms and one for the absolutive forms. 
For the dative forms, I made an oblique stem noun type, and a noun position class to add the dative suffix. 
For the case person agreement on verbs with 1st and 2nd person subjects, I added temporary dummy suffixes for 
now to parse the sentences.

Agreement - noun/verb gender/number

Tsova-Tush has five full grammatical genders and three inquorate genders (containing a limited number of nouns
that are treated as an exception).  The genders are defined by the agreement class markers a noun triggers on an
agreement target in singular/plural.  The name v/b means nouns of that gender trigger a v- class marker for a singular noun
and a b- target for a plural noun. I chose to focus on only the five full genders to start. The five full genders are as follows:

v/b
j/d
j/j
d/d
d/j

Follows are sample sentences demonstaring the agreement pattern of nouns of different genders.  Note that the gender categories
use the character j (I followed the convention in our literature) but the prefixes are written as y- in our corpus.

It became clear there were multiple lexical rules licensing the various prefixes - some were restricted by gender, and some
were not.  It also was evident the original choices file did not have the correct genders - it merely defined two genders, m
and f, whereas Tsova-Tush has five full genders.

I attempted to remove any lexical rules that were licensing prefixes on verbs without restricting the gender or number of the noun
subject of the verb.  

I created new classes for nouns of the various genders.

I created several new lexical rules licensing the various prefixes, with the hope that the resulting verb would fail to unify with
any nouns that were not the correct number or gender.

I ran into significant issues with this process.  The first is that all the nouns were underspecified for both number and gender.  When
I attempted to specify singular number on the nouns, this prevented the plural nouns (with the -i suffix) from parsing, because that 
suffix -i only is able to combine with plural or underspecified nouns.  I hope in morphology next week we will address how to create
lexical rules that take singular input, and output plural.  I also found that coordination and determiners were complicating things,
because the coordination and head-specifier rules of the determiners were leading to NPs of varying genders, despite what I had 
specified in the lexical entry for the noun.  I still have a lot of work I need to do to prevent the parsing of ungrammatical sentences.

Additionally, when I created new lexical entries in the correct gender type, the lexical entry for q'ar "rain" became corrupted.

6. Phenomena in our language not covered by our starter grammar is certainly gender - the starter grammar inferred two genders,
and did not specify gender for any of the lexical entries, but our grammar has 5 full and 3 inquorate genders.  Case was not 
specified for nouns, so new noun types had to be added.
